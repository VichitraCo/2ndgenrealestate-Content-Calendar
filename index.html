    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive dashboard to transform the static content calendar into a dynamic planning tool. The structure is thematic and task-oriented, rather than a simple chronological list, to enhance usability. It features a top-level summary of key metrics (total posts, content type breakdown), followed by a powerful filtering system. The core of the app is a tabbed interface allowing users to switch between a full calendar view, a sponsor-centric view, and a team-centric view. This structure was chosen because it allows the social media manager to not only see the timeline but also to quickly analyze the content mix, check sponsor post distribution, and review team-specific content, making strategic planning much easier than with a linear table. Clicking a post card opens a detailed modal, keeping the main view clean and scannable. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Full 50-post calendar. Goal: Organize & Explore. Viz: Interactive grid of post cards. Interaction: Click to expand details, filter by type/phase. Justification: A grid is more visually engaging than a table and filtering allows for targeted planning. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: Content types (Reel, Photo, etc.). Goal: Analyze content mix. Viz: Bar Chart. Interaction: Hover for tooltips. Justification: A chart provides a quick, visual summary of the content strategy. Library: Chart.js.
        - Report Info: Sponsor/Team lists. Goal: Organize & Relate. Viz: Clickable lists/tags. Interaction: Click to filter the main calendar. Justification: This creates a relational view, making it easy to track obligations for specific partners. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: Individual post details. Goal: Inform. Viz: Modal window. Interaction: Click on a card to open. Justification: Keeps the main interface uncluttered while providing full details on demand. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
